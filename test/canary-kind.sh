# The release canary (test/canary.py) against the local kind cluster: the
# whole system built from this checkout (hack/local-up.sh), reached the way
# production is, through Pomerium on the API host with an API token.
#
#   test/canary-kind.sh           brings the cluster up (or up to date) first
#   UP=0 test/canary-kind.sh      against the cluster as it is
#
# It is what a pull request is held to before it merges
# (.github/workflows/canary-kind.yml). What kind cannot show, and production's
# canary does: gVisor, Pod Snapshots (sleep saves nothing here, and wake
# starts the session fresh), the warm pool, the canary create option (the
# local blueprint names its images by tag), and the images as the registry
# has them (these are built here, from the same source). docs/releases.md.
#
# The token is made here, for the local admin, by writing its record to the
# cluster as the backend would; it is deleted afterwards.
