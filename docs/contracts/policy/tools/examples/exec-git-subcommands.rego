# Three patterns: the program compared as a whole string; the subcommand at
# args[0], which also keeps git's own options (-c, -C, --exec-path, which
# come before the subcommand) out; and flags denied anywhere after it.
#
# The denied flags are the weak part: a list of what its author knew about.
# (Git accepts any unambiguous abbreviation of a long flag, "--outp" for
# "--output", which is why the rule below matches prefixes.) And git reads
# the configuration of the repository it is run in, which can name programs
# for git to run (core.fsmonitor, diff drivers): this policy is safe for
# repositories the agent cannot write to, not for arbitrary ones.
