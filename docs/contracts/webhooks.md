# Session tool-call webhooks

Configure one webhook per session in its **Webhook** tab, or through the API:

```
PUT /v1/sessions/{id}/webhook
Authorization: Bearer <API token with sessions:write>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://example.com/tool-calls",
  "batch_size": 100,
  "flush_interval_seconds": 5,
  "signing_secret": "at-least-sixteen-bytes",
  "filter": ""
}
```

The app uses the corresponding `/api/sessions/{id}/webhook` routes. GET
requires `sessions:read` and returns the configuration (or null when disabled),
with `has_signing_secret` in place of the secret. PUT validates the complete
configuration and filter before saving; it returns 204. Omit `signing_secret`
to retain the existing value, or send an empty string to clear it. DELETE
requires `sessions:write`, returns 204, and disables exports. Session ownership
and session-bound tokens apply to all three routes.

Settings are persisted as `SessionPolicy.spec.webhook`. The policy operator
validates them again, including for direct Kubernetes writes. Invalid direct
writes refuse new captured calls for that session until corrected. Settings apply when reconciled;
changing or disabling a destination affects new capture only. Previously
accepted events retain their original destination, filter, and signing secret
and continue delivery until acknowledged. Configured tool calls depend on a
durable capture commit; ingestion failures refuse execution.

## Events and batches

Outer MCP `tools/call` requests, including `run_js`, are durably recorded by
the backend before forwarding. Nested browser and shell attempts are recorded
by MCPJS's native `mcp_tools.pre` hook, before its local and remote enforcement
policies. These are distinct events: one `run_js` can produce several nested
attempts. Attempts subsequently denied by a policy are captured too. The hook
cannot observe the later authorization verdict, so new nested events have
`stage: "attempt"` and no `allowed` field. Results, screenshots, and return
values are not exported. A captured attempt does not imply execution.

The destination receives an uncompressed JSON POST:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "batch_id": "7ddc473b-8b51-4190-bf2a-a7e91e3b09b7",
  "session_id": "s-abcdefghij",
  "events": [{
    "id": "unique-event-id",
    "session_id": "s-abcdefghij",
    "timestamp": "2026-10-03T12:00:00Z",
    "type": "tool_call",
    "stage": "attempt",
    "server": "exec",
    "tool": "exec",
    "arguments": {"bin": "git", "args": ["status"]}
  }]
}
```

Outer calls have `stage: "request"`, `server: "mcp-js"`, and a JSON-RPC
`request_id`, with no `allowed` field. Outer arguments over 1 MiB are omitted
and marked `arguments_truncated: true`. Requests over 16 MiB are refused before forwarding. Nested arguments too
large for a 2 MiB delivery are omitted with `arguments_truncated: true`; the
event itself is retained.

A batch contains at most `batch_size` events (1–500; default 100), also capped
at 2 MiB. Partial batches wait `flush_interval_seconds` (1–60; default 5).
Full batches wake delivery immediately. Nested events are durably recorded
before MCPJS continues to enforcement policies. Persistence adds call latency;
filter evaluation and HTTP delivery run asynchronously. Ordering across independent destination versions is not
guaranteed.

## Rego filters

An empty filter includes every event. Otherwise, use the existing restricted
Rego policy contract: `package computeruse.policy`, define `allow_tool_call`,
no references to `data`, no `with`, and the enforcement capabilities allowlist.
The filter's `input` is one event from the schema above. Only boolean `true`
includes it; false, undefined, or other values omit it. Evaluation errors and
timeouts retain events and retry evaluation; they never discard events.
Filtering selects delivery without changing the authorization verdict.

Export nested browser or shell attempts:

```rego
package computeruse.policy
import rego.v1

default allow_tool_call := false

allow_tool_call if {
  input.stage == "attempt"
  input.server in {"browser", "exec"}
}
```

Export outer calls and shell calls:

```rego
package computeruse.policy
import rego.v1

allow_tool_call if input.server in {"mcp-js", "exec"}
```

## Signing and delivery

Endpoints must use public HTTPS on port 443. Credentials in the URL, private
IP literals, redirects, and DNS answers containing non-public addresses are
refused. DNS checks apply to actual connection resolution, with no DNS cache
or environment proxy. TLS verification remains enabled.

Every delivery has `X-Computer-Use-Batch-ID`. With a secret configured it also
has `X-Computer-Use-Timestamp` (Unix seconds) and `X-Computer-Use-Signature`
(`sha256=<hex>`). Verify HMAC-SHA256 over `timestamp + "." + raw request body`,
using constant-time comparison and a suitable timestamp tolerance. Each retry
uses the same body and batch ID, with a fresh timestamp/signature.

A 2xx response acknowledges delivery. Every other status and transport failure
retries indefinitely, with exponential delays capped at five minutes and a
10-second HTTP timeout. Retry count and next-attempt time survive restarts.
The same persisted batch ID and body are used for every retry. A crash after
the receiver accepts but before acknowledgement is committed replays the batch.

This is **durable at-least-once delivery** for accepted, filter-selected events.
Receivers must deduplicate event IDs transactionally with their own processing
to obtain exactly-once effects. No HTTP sender can ensure exactly-once receiver
processing when an acknowledgement can be lost.

## Durable capture and deployment

The singleton policy operator uses Redis Streams with a durable prepared-batch
record. The bundled Redis StatefulSet retains its 10 GiB PVC, uses AOF with
`appendfsync always`, and forbids eviction. Each atomic queue mutation is followed
by `WAITAOF 1 0 2000` on the same connection before acceptance is acknowledged.
Pending events, prepared batches, destination snapshots, retry state, and receipts
survive Redis and operator process crashes. External Redis must support WAITAOF
(Redis 7.2+) and use these persistence and eviction settings; startup refuses a
weaker configuration. Set `WEBHOOK_REDIS_URL`, `WEBHOOK_REDIS_PASSWORD`, and
optionally `WEBHOOK_REDIS_PREFIX` to configure it. The offline CLI does not connect
to Redis and never captures live calls.

The existing `opa:8181` Service continues to route directly to OPA replicas;
authorization is unchanged. Enforcing session templates install a native remote
pre hook alongside their existing policies:

```json
{
  "mcp_tools": {
    "pre": [{
      "url": "http://policy-operator.browserjs-sessions.svc:8080",
      "policy_path": "browserjs/hooks/s-abcdefghij/mcp_tools/pre"
    }],
    "mode": "all",
    "policies": [
      {"url": "file:///etc/mcp/mcp_tools.rego"},
      {"url": "http://opa.browserjs-sessions.svc:8181", "policy_path": "browserjs/decision/s-abcdefghij/mcp_tools"}
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook accepts OPA-style `{ "input": ... }` requests and returns
`{ "result": true }` only after durable capture (or when exports are disabled).
MCPJS interprets errors as hook failures and refuses execution. Pre hooks precede
the policy chain, so a later policy denial still has an attempt event. There is
no final-verdict or denied-only export filter for native attempt events. The
pinned MCPJS v0.21.0-rc.4 supports this contract. Session network policies allow
the collector on 8080 and OPA on 8181; Redis is accessible only to the collector.
Administrative collector routes remain bearer-protected. OPA asynchronous
logging is not the capture source; `/logs` is retained only for legacy producers,
whose buffering is outside the durable capture guarantee.

For configured outer calls, the backend checks the saved webhook configuration
and requires the collector to have applied that same configuration before it
acknowledges capture. It refuses the call on recorder unavailability, disk
failure, or capacity pressure. The native pre hook likewise refuses to continue until the
nested attempt is committed. An event may be recorded for a call that
subsequently fails or never executes; events describe attempts, not successful
execution.

The outbox refuses new acceptance when pending event bytes would exceed 256 MiB
or Redis cannot persist the mutation. It never evicts an accepted event. Captured calls are
therefore refused rather than silently lost. A permanently unreachable endpoint
or a permanently failing filter retains its backlog until repaired, and can
eventually prevent new captured calls. Successful filter exclusions are an
intentional terminal disposition and are not delivered. Completed event IDs
remain as durable receipts; storage exhaustion rejects new acceptance.

Disabling a webhook stops new capture but does not cancel previously accepted
batches. Changing the URL or signing secret applies to newly accepted events;
old events keep their original configuration. Deleting a session also preserves
its accepted backlog.

Deploy the updated CRD, network policies, session hook templates, backend, and
policy-operator image together. With Argo CD, apply the SessionPolicy CRD
schema through the bootstrap procedure before releasing; cluster-scoped CRDs
are excluded from GitOps workload sync. The rendered release installs Redis,
network policies and namespaced RBAC before starting the operator. Recreate existing sessions from the updated blueprint to install the hooks;
restarting a pod retains its stored Sandbox template. Webhook enablement
returns HTTP 409 for templates without the native hook. warm-pool templates carry the
pod name as the session ID. Hook ingestion verifies the source pod IP against
Kubernetes-watched session pods. Forwarded headers are ignored;
this requires the cluster CNI to preserve pod source IPs and prevent IP spoofing. The recorder is on the pre-hook path: while the
singleton operator is unavailable, hooked nested calls are refused, including
for sessions without exports. Do not use `emptyDir` for Redis or
scale the operator above one replica. Redis has a 1 GiB memory limit and no
automatic failover; provision more memory and storage as receipt history grows.
The guarantee assumes Redis and its PVC honour successful fsync; volume destruction or storage
corruption requires backup recovery.

The MCPJS image sets `RES_OPTIONS=use-vc` for TCP DNS lookups. This avoids
UDP resolver stalls consuming the native hook's five-second HTTP deadline
during pod replacement. TCP port 53 remains allowed only to cluster and
node-local DNS by the session NetworkPolicy. Recorder/DNS unavailability
still refuses the tool call; no retry can authorize an unrecorded attempt.
