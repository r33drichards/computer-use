# Warm pool

A new session used to take about 103 s to start (node 38 s, disk 25 s, image
pull 36 s, start 4 s). With the warm pool, a node's worth of session pods (seven)
is always running with nobody in them, and creating a session hands one of
them over. The pool then starts the next one in the background.

Sources, and what is and is not confirmed, are at the end.

## How it works

Three Agent Sandbox resources of `extensions.agents.x-k8s.io/v1beta1`:

- `SandboxTemplate/session` (`deploy/gke/warmpool.yaml`): the session pod
  and its 32Gi disk, the same as `deploy/gke/blueprint.yaml`.
- `SandboxWarmPool/s`: keeps `replicas` (7) Sandboxes of that template
  running. Each is a complete `Sandbox` named `s-<5 characters>`, with its pod
  and its `data-s-…` disk, owned by the pool.
- `SandboxClaim`: made by the backend for each new session. The claim
  controller binds it to a waiting Sandbox, which keeps its name, pod and
  disk and becomes the claim's instead of the pool's.

`Store.Create` (`backend/internal/sessions/warm.go`), when `WARM_POOL` is set:

1. creates a `SandboxClaim` carrying the owner label, owner and name;
2. waits up to `WARM_POOL_WAIT` (5 s) for `status.sandbox.name`;
3. writes the owner label, the owner and name annotations, the adoption time
   and `operatingMode: Running` onto that Sandbox, in one compare-and-swap
   that refuses a Sandbox that is not the claim's or already has an owner.

The session's ID is the Sandbox's name, as it always was, so nothing after
creation changes: the proxy, the hosts, authorization, the idle sweep, sleep
and wake all see an ordinary session Sandbox. If any step fails the claim is
deleted and the session starts cold from the blueprint, as before.

Two things follow from "the ID is the Sandbox's name":

- **The pool must be named `s`.** The pool names its Sandboxes
  `<pool>-<5 characters>`; `ValidID` accepts `s-` plus ten base32 characters
  (cold) or five characters (warm). `WARM_POOL` set to anything else is
  refused at startup.
- **The public URL comes from the pod's name.** A cold session gets
  `MCP_V8_PUBLIC_URL` rendered into its pod. A warm pod exists before its
  session, and the claim controller cannot add a variable to a running pod
  (a claim with `env` is always started cold). But a Sandbox's pod has the
  Sandbox's name, which is the session ID from the start, so the template
  sets `SESSION_ID` from `metadata.name` and
  `MCP_V8_PUBLIC_URL=https://sessions.computeruse.site/$(SESSION_ID)`. No image
  changes.

**Delete** removes the session's snapshots, then the claim, then the Sandbox. A Sandbox deleted from
under its claim would be replaced: the claim controller binds the claim to
another one. This holds whether or not `WARM_POOL` is still set.

**A crash between steps 1 and 3** leaves a running Sandbox with no owner,
which no user and no idle sweep can see. The claim already names the owner,
so `Store.RecoverClaims` finishes the job at the backend's next start.

**The pod has no owner label.** A cold session's pod is labelled
`browserjs.dev/owner`. A claim may only add pod labels from the controller's
allow-list (`sandbox.users.io` by default), and nothing reads the pod's
label; the Sandbox has it.

## With Pod Snapshots

A session from the pool sleeps to a snapshot and wakes from it like any
other ([gke-deployment.md](gke-deployment.md)); nothing in that path looks at
where the Sandbox came from.

- The `PodSnapshotPolicy` selects pods by `app: browserjs-session`, which
  the template has, and groups by `agents.x-k8s.io/sandbox-name-hash`, which
  the Sandbox controller derives from the Sandbox's name. Adoption changes
  neither.
- The pin to the snapshot's node pool is written into the Sandbox's
  `podTemplate.spec.nodeSelector`. The claim controller only ever rewrites
  the pod template's labels and annotations, so the pin stays.
- Delete removes the snapshots first, as before: a failure there leaves the
  whole session to delete again. Then the claim, then the Sandbox.
- **Names come round again.** A pod is restored from the newest snapshot of
  its Sandbox's name, and the pool has about 14 million names where the
  backend's own IDs have 2^50. A session removed without its snapshots (with
  kubectl rather than through the app) leaves one that a later pooled
  Sandbox of the same name would be restored from. So before a pooled
  Sandbox is given to anyone, the backend looks for snapshots under its
  name; if there are any, the Sandbox and then the snapshots are deleted and
  the session starts cold.

## What a waiting session is

It runs Chromium and mcp-js on a fresh disk and has never run anybody's code:
a Sandbox is handed out once and is never returned to the pool. The
`session-pods` NetworkPolicy applies to it (same `app` label). It has no owner
label, so it is in nobody's list, the proxy refuses its host, and the idle
sweep never puts it to sleep.

## Size: one node of warm sessions

The pool is sized in nodes of overhead: `replicas` in
`deploy/gke/warmpool.yaml` is **overhead nodes x 7**, and is the one number
to change. It is 7 (one node).

**Why 7.** A session pod requests 200m CPU and 1280Mi. A session node
(n2-standard-4; `cluster info` run
[36961294377](https://github.com/r33drichards/computer-use/actions/runs/36961294377)):

| | CPU | memory |
|---|---|---|
| allocatable | 3920m | 13273Mi |
| GKE's own 11 pods (anetd, fluentbit, metadata server, snapshot agent, ...) | 707m | 1176Mi |
| left for sessions | 3213m | 12097Mi |
| session pods that fit | 16 | **9** |

Memory decides: nine session pods a node. Seven are warm and two places are
left free, so that a sleeping session waking up, or a session started cold,
has room on the node that is already running, and the pool on its own never
asks for a second node. The fallback pools (n2d-standard-4, c3-standard-4)
have the same 4 vCPU and 16 GB; that their allocatable is the same is
UNVERIFIED.

The two free places only help a waking session whose disk is in that node's
zone and, if it has a snapshot, whose snapshot was taken on that node's pool.
Any other needs its own node, as it does today.

**As sessions are claimed.** A claimed pod stays where it is and the pool
starts a replacement, so the cluster holds *sessions running + 7* pods:

| sessions running | pods | session nodes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 to 2 | 7 to 9 | 1 |
| 3 to 11 | 10 to 18 | 2 |
| 12 to 20 | 19 to 27 | 3 |

The third session's replacement finds no room and stays pending, and the
autoscaler adds a node for it: capacity arrives ahead of demand, and what is
spare stays at about one node. A pool can only empty if more than seven
sessions are created within one node start-up (about 100 s); the eighth
then starts cold. `session_max_nodes` (3 a pool) is still the ceiling.

**Scale-down.** Session pods mount an `emptyDir` (`/dev/shm`), and the
cluster autoscaler does not remove a node holding such a pod unless the pod
is marked `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "true"`. So:

- A node goes away once it holds no session pod and no warm pod. Sessions
  leave by sleeping (15 minutes idle) or being deleted.
- New warm pods are placed on the fullest node that has room (the cluster's
  `OPTIMIZE_UTILIZATION` profile), so after a busy spell the pool drifts back
  onto one node as its pods are claimed and replaced.
- **But nothing moves a warm pod that is not claimed.** If use stops while
  the seven are spread over two nodes, both nodes stay up, each half empty,
  until enough warm pods have been claimed from the emptier one. Even where
  eviction is allowed it would rarely help: a warm pod's disk is zonal, and
  the two nodes are usually in different zones.
- Upstream's controller can mark pooled pods safe to evict (and unmark them
  on adoption); whether GKE's does is UNVERIFIED. `hack/gke-status.sh` shows
  the annotation and the node of every session pod. Setting the annotation
  in the template is not an option: it would stay on the pod after adoption
  and let the autoscaler evict sessions in use.
- The mitigation, not built because it is code rather than a manifest
  setting: have the backend's sweep delete pool-owned Sandboxes on a node
  that holds no session while the pool's other node has room; the pool
  makes them again on the fuller node.
- A deploy that changes the template replaces all seven at once
  (`updateStrategy: Recreate`). For a moment there are fourteen pods, which
  can start a second node and leave the pool split as above.

**Which machine type.** Warm pods select only gVisor nodes, like any
session, so they go to whichever of the three pools the autoscaler picks
(today's node is the `sessions` pool, n2). That is harmless for a warm pod:
it has no snapshot, and a session is pinned to a pool only once it has
slept on it. Nothing ping-pongs: a pod stays on its node until that node
is reclaimed, and its replacement may then be another machine type, with
nothing depending on which. No preference was added. A preferred node
affinity is ignored by the autoscaler when it chooses a pool, and a required
one would give up the fallback pools, which exist for when a Spot machine
type has no capacity.

## Sizes

The pool holds small sessions only: its template is the blueprint, and the
blueprint is the size small. A medium or large session
([session-sizes.md](session-sizes.md)) is never taken from the pool; it
starts cold from the blueprint with that size's numbers. Keeping bigger
ones warm would mean a template and a pool for each, and a waiting large
pod holds a whole node.

The pool's node is also why a medium session does not land beside it: seven
waiting pods leave 3137Mi of the node's 12097Mi, and a medium asks for
3328Mi. With the second session node taken by bigger sessions, the pool's
replacements for claimed pods wait as `Pending` once the first node's nine
places are used.

## Turning it off

- `replicas: 0` in `warmpool.yaml`: nothing waits, nothing is paid; sessions
  are still made through claims and start cold.
- Remove `WARM_POOL` from `deploy/gke/patch-backend.yaml`: the backend makes
  Sandboxes itself as before. Sessions that came from the pool keep working
  and can be deleted. `deploy/local` does not set it.

## Cost

Per node of overhead, around the clock, from the table in
[infrastructure.md](infrastructure.md) section 7 (n2-standard-4, us-west1,
730 h; node + 100 GB boot disk + NAT). Session nodes are Spot today.

| | per hour | per month |
|---|---|---|
| Spot | $0.1316 | about $96 |
| On demand | $0.2093 | about $153 |

plus the seven waiting 32 GB disks, $22.40 a month. With nobody online that
takes the cluster's idle bill from about $78 to about $197 on Spot. While
three or more sessions run, the second node is a second $0.13 an hour that a
cluster without the pool would only pay from its tenth session; and a pool
left split over two nodes (above) costs two.

## Sources and what is confirmed

- **Served versions.** VERIFIED on the cluster (`cluster info` run
  [36957250957](https://github.com/r33drichards/computer-use/actions/runs/36957250957)):
  `sandboxclaims`, `sandboxtemplates` and `sandboxwarmpools` in
  `extensions.agents.x-k8s.io` serve `v1alpha1,v1beta1`; the add-on's
  component version is 1.36.12.
- **Behaviour.** Read from upstream
  [kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox)
  at v0.5.6, the last release that has both `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1`
  (v1.0.0 dropped `v1alpha1`): `extensions/api/v1beta1/*_types.go`,
  `extensions/controllers/sandboxwarmpool_controller.go` (`buildSandboxCR`:
  the pool creates whole Sandboxes, volume claim templates included, with
  `generateName: <pool>-`), `sandboxclaim_controller.go` (`completeAdoption`:
  ownership moves to the claim, the name stays; `getOrCreateSandbox`: a claim
  with `env` or `volumeClaimTemplates` skips the pool; a claim whose Sandbox
  is gone takes another) and `controllers/sandbox_controller.go` (the pod is
  named after the Sandbox, the disk `<template>-<sandbox>`; `operatingMode`
  is handled there, and the claim controller never writes it).
- **UNVERIFIED: that GKE's managed controller is that code.** Google's
  [CRD reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/crds/agentsandbox)
  describes a claim with `sandboxTemplateRef` (the `v1alpha1` shape) and the
  [how-to](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/agent-sandbox)
  speaks of warm *pods* owned by the pool, which is how upstream worked
  before v0.5. If the cluster behaves that way, a warm pod has no disk and
  not the session's name. The backend then still makes working sessions
  (the claim is refused or times out, and the session starts cold), but the
  pool is wasted. Check before relying on it: `hack/gke-status.sh --full`
  prints the fields the served `v1beta1` schemas accept and each Sandbox's
  owner.
- **UNVERIFIED on the cluster, with snapshots:** that a pod adopted from the
  pool restores (GKE restores "into an identical pod spec"; the spec is the
  same, but the pod's labels were changed by adoption between its start and
  its snapshot), and that the waiting pod, which matches the snapshot
  policy's selector, is left alone until the backend triggers a snapshot.
- **UNVERIFIED on the cluster:** that adoption does not restart the pod
  (the claim controller rewrites the Sandbox's pod labels), sleep and wake of
  an adopted Sandbox, and how the pool behaves when a Spot node is reclaimed.
