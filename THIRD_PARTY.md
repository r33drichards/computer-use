# Third-party software

The source in this repository is under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). It
contains build recipes (Dockerfiles, a Nix flake, lock files) for images that
bundle other software; that software is not in this repository and keeps its
own licence. If you publish the images you build, you distribute those
programs and take on their terms. Versions are fixed by `images/*/flake.lock`,
the image digests in the Dockerfiles, and the lock files.
