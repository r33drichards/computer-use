# Write a policy

A policy decides which of the agent's calls a session accepts. It does not
restrict you at the screen. Policies are live for new sessions; a new session
starts unrestricted unless you choose another policy.

Sessions created before enforcement remain unrestricted, including after
sleep and wake. They show an unsupported policy and cannot be given one.
To use a policy, create a replacement session and move the work you need
before deleting the old one.

## Choose a starting point

When you create a session, choose a ready-made policy, copy one from another
session, or write your own. The ready-made ones:

| Policy | What the agent may do |
| --- | --- |
| Unrestricted | Everything: the browser, the desktop and the shell |
| Browser only | Every browser operation. No desktop control, no shell |
| No scripting | Everything in the browser except running script in a page or replacing its content. No desktop control, no shell |
| Observe only | Open https pages, wait, take screenshots. No desktop control, no shell |
| One site | Work on one site and its subdomains, with short typed text. No desktop control, no shell |
| Form filling | Fill in forms on the sites you name: printable text, a few keys, no script. No desktop control, no shell |
| Read-only shell | Everything in the browser, and a short list of read-only commands. No desktop control |

Each is a short Rego module with comments. Pick the closest and edit it.

## Write one

1. Open the session's **Policy** tab and choose **Edit**.
2. Say what is allowed. Everything else is refused, on every tool: a policy
   that only speaks of the browser refuses desktop control and the shell.

```txt
package computeruse.policy

import rego.v1

allow_tool_call if {
	input.server == "browser"
	input.tool == "browser_execute"
	every op in input.arguments.operations {
		op.type in {"navigate", "screenshot", "url", "wait"}
	}
}
```

3. Try calls against it in the editor before saving.
4. Choose **Save policy**. Wait for **Policy saved and in force** before
   relying on the new rules. If the app says **Policy saved; loading**, the
   previous policy stays in force until the new one is loaded. If it cannot
   compile, the previous policy stays in force and the app shows the errors.

Programs are decided the same way. A call to run one arrives as the program
and its arguments, already separate, so a rule can name them. This policy
allows `git`, with two subcommands, and reading the output:

```txt
package computeruse.policy

import rego.v1

allow_tool_call if {
	input.server == "exec"
	input.tool == "exec"
	count(object.keys(input.arguments) - {"bin", "args", "timeout", "cwd"}) == 0
	input.arguments.bin == "git"
	input.arguments.args[0] in {"status", "log"}
	input.arguments.timeout <= 120
}

allow_tool_call if {
	input.server == "exec"
	input.tool in {"stream_logs", "search_logs", "kill"}
}
```

The third line of the first rule refuses a call with any other field, `env`
among them: environment variables such as `PATH` change what a program name
means. Compare `bin` as a whole (`"git"`, not "starts with git"), and deny a
shell (`bin` of `sh` or `bash`) unless every command is acceptable, since a
shell's command line cannot be judged by matching text. A policy like this
one, which does not mention the browser tools, refuses them.

Do not list `sh`, `bash`, `env` or `xargs`: each runs any other program, and
saving a policy that allows one beside a list of programs shows a warning.
The **Read-only shell** policy is a fuller example.

The package name is fixed. It carries the product's earlier name, as a few
technical identifiers do.

## Keep the rules from being walked around

If a policy restricts the browser, keep desktop control and the shell
refused: the mouse and keyboard, or a program, can drive the browser around
the rules. If it restricts the shell, keep desktop control refused: the
keyboard can type into a terminal. Saving a policy that leaves one open
shows a warning that says which.

## Manage it as code

Mark the policy as managed as code and keep it in Terraform or OpenTofu, or
send it through the API. The app then shows it read-only, with a link to
where it is managed. See [Use it from code](/guides/use-from-code).

## Check what it does not cover

A rule on `navigate` limits where the agent may send the browser. It does
not stop a page from linking or redirecting elsewhere. Read
[The containment model](/explanation/containment) before relying on a
policy.

The format is in [Policy format](/reference/policy).
