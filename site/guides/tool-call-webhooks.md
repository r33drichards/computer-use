# Send tool calls to a webhook

Open a session and choose its **Webhook** tab. Enter a public HTTPS URL, then
choose how many events to send per batch and how long to wait before sending
a partial batch. Click **Save webhook**. Use **Disable new exports** to stop capturing new events. Accepted events continue delivery.

Events include outer tool calls such as `run_js`, plus nested browser and shell
attempts, including calls subsequently denied by enforcement policies. A single `run_js` request can
therefore produce several events. Events contain tool arguments; execution
results and screenshots are excluded.

## Filter which events are sent

Leave **Rego filter** empty to export every event. To select events, write a
module with `package browserjs.policy` and an `allow_tool_call` rule. The
filter receives one event as `input`, and includes it only when the rule
returns boolean `true`.

For example, send only nested browser or shell attempts:

```rego
package browserjs.policy
import rego.v1

default allow_tool_call := false

allow_tool_call if {
  input.stage == "attempt"
  input.server in {"browser", "exec"}
}
```

To send only shell calls:

```rego
package browserjs.policy
import rego.v1

allow_tool_call if input.server == "exec"
```

Filters use the same language restrictions as [session policies](/reference/policy).
A filter selects exports; it does not change what the agent is allowed to do.

## Receive a batch

Your endpoint receives a JSON POST like this:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "batch_id": "unique-batch-id",
  "session_id": "s-abcdefghij",
  "events": [{
    "id": "unique-event-id",
    "session_id": "s-abcdefghij",
    "timestamp": "2026-10-03T12:00:00Z",
    "type": "tool_call",
    "stage": "attempt",
    "server": "exec",
    "tool": "exec",
    "arguments": {"bin": "git", "args": ["status"]}
  }]
}
```

Return a 2xx status to acknowledge receipt. Delivery failures are retried until acknowledged, including after restarts. Deduplicate by event ID because retries can produce duplicates.
The batch ID also appears in `X-Computer-Use-Batch-ID`.

Outer calls have `stage: "request"` and `server: "mcp-js"`; they have no
`allowed` field. Browser and shell events have `stage: "attempt"` and no `allowed` field.
The native pre hook records attempts before authorization; it cannot report
the final verdict or whether execution succeeded. Denied-only filtering is
therefore unavailable.

## Verify signatures

Set an optional signing secret of 16–256 bytes. Each delivery then includes
`X-Computer-Use-Timestamp` (Unix seconds) and `X-Computer-Use-Signature`
(`sha256=<hex>`). Calculate HMAC-SHA256 over the timestamp, a period, and the
raw request body. Compare signatures in constant time and check the timestamp
against a tolerance suitable for your receiver.

Leaving the secret field blank when saving keeps the existing secret.

## Delivery guarantees and limits

Delivery is **at least once**. The recorder commits events to a persistent
Redis queue with AOF persistence before allowing a configured tool call to proceed. Pending batches and
retry state survive recorder and Redis restarts. A failed delivery retries indefinitely,
with exponential delays capped at five minutes. Calls are refused if their
event cannot be durably recorded, including when the recorder is unavailable
or the outbox is full.

A lost acknowledgement can cause the same batch to be delivered again. For
exactly-once effects, your receiver must deduplicate event IDs in the same
transaction as processing the events.

Batch size is 1–500 events, with a 2 MiB byte limit. The partial-batch interval
is 1–60 seconds; a full batch starts delivery immediately. Filter evaluation
failures retain events and retry. A permanently failing endpoint or filter can
fill the outbox and prevent new captured calls until it is repaired.

Changing or disabling a webhook affects new capture only. Previously accepted
events keep their original destination, filter, and signing secret and continue
retrying until acknowledged. Deleting a session also preserves accepted events.

Outer arguments over 1 MiB and nested arguments exceeding the batch byte limit
are omitted and marked `arguments_truncated: true`; the event itself is retained.
Requests over 16 MiB are refused before execution.

Webhook endpoints must use HTTPS on port 443. Private addresses and redirects
are refused. The guarantee depends on preserving the recorder's persistent
volume. Deleting that volume removes pending deliveries and receipts.

The API also supports `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}/webhook`.
Reads require `sessions:read`; writes require `sessions:write`. PUT accepts
`url`, `batch_size`, `flush_interval_seconds`, optional `filter`, and optional
`signing_secret`. GET returns `has_signing_secret` in place of the secret.
